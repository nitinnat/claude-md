## What is a Design System?

---

*   **Definition:** A single source of truth for design language, standards, and reusable components.
*   **Beyond Style Guides:** More than just colors and fonts; a holistic ecosystem.
*   **Living Document:** Constantly evolving with the product and team.
*   **Goal:** To create consistent, efficient, and scalable digital experiences.

## Benefits of a Design System

---

*   **Consistency:**  Ensures a unified user experience across all products and platforms.
*   **Efficiency:**  Reduces design and development time by reusing pre-built components.
*   **Scalability:**  Facilitates the creation of new features and products quickly and easily.
*   **Collaboration:**  Provides a shared language and framework for designers and developers.
*   **Reduced Costs:**  Streamlines workflows and eliminates redundant work.

## Component Libraries: The Building Blocks

---

*   **Definition:** A collection of reusable UI elements, patterns, and code snippets.
*   **Concrete Implementation:**  The tangible manifestation of design system principles.
*   **Code-First Approach:** Focused on developer needs and ease of implementation.
*   **Examples:** Buttons, forms, navigation, modals, etc.
