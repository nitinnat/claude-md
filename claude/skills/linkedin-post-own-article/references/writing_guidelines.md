# Writing Guidelines for LinkedIn Posts About Your Own Articles

## Core Principle: Share Your Work, Don't Sell It

When sharing an article you wrote, the goal is not to promote yourself or drive traffic. The goal is to share interesting work and invite genuine engagement. Your post should answer: "Why did I write this? What did I learn? Why might others find this valuable?"

## Three Approaches, One Voice

### Variation 1: Inspiration & Motivation
**When to use:** When the journey or motivation is more interesting than the solution
**Lead with:** What inspired or motivated you to tackle this topic
**Example opening:** "I spent the last month exploring..." or "I noticed a pattern that bugged me..."

**Structure:**
1. What problem or question motivated you
2. What you explored or built
3. The insight or learning you discovered
4. Why others might care

### Variation 2: Problem & Solution
**When to use:** When you solved a concrete problem with broad applicability
**Lead with:** The problem you were facing
**Example opening:** "I kept running into..." or "We had a situation where..."

**Structure:**
1. The problem (be specific about why it mattered)
2. Why existing approaches didn't work
3. Your solution and how it works
4. The result and implications

### Variation 3: Key Insight
**When to use:** When the main value is a discovery or realization
**Lead with:** The insight or realization you made
**Example opening:** "I discovered..." or "What surprised me was..."

**Structure:**
1. The insight or discovery
2. Why it matters (implications)
3. How you validated or applied it
4. What it means for others

## Writing Principles

### 1. Be Specific
Vague posts feel corporate and inauthentic. Use real numbers, concrete examples, specific technical terms.

**Vague:** "I built something that saves time on project setup"
**Specific:** "This template cuts setup time from 2-3 days to 5 minutes by pre-configuring FastAPI, PostgreSQL with connection pooling, Redis caching, Celery workers, and local LLM inference"

### 2. Use Your Real Voice
Write like you speak. Use contractions, casual language, natural pacing.

**Stilted:** "The aforementioned template facilitates rapid initialization of project infrastructure"
**Natural:** "The template gets you up and running in minutes"

### 3. Show the Work, Not the Result
People are more interested in how you think than in the final product. Share the process, the tradeoffs, the discoveries.

**Product-focused:** "I built a RL system that increased engagement by 15%"
**Process-focused:** "I discovered that treating notification delivery as an RL problem lets us optimize across channels simultaneously, something our four separate models couldn't do"

### 4. Mix Insight with Context
Don't assume everyone knows the domain. Explain why your approach matters, not just how it works.

**Technical but unclear:** "We use doubly stochastic matrices for stability guarantees"
**Technical with context:** "We use doubly stochastic matrices (rows and columns sum to 1) to guarantee mathematical stability, preventing the output from exploding across layers"

### 5. Be Honest About Limitations
Real work has constraints and tradeoffs. Mentioning them makes you more credible, not less.

**Overselling:** "This is the perfect solution for all project setup needs"
**Honest:** "This template works well for Python/FastAPI projects. If you're using Go or Node, you'd want a different stack"

## What NOT to Do

### Emojis
No emojis. Not decorative ones, not the rocket ship, not the pointing finger.
- ❌ "Just launched my new template! 🚀"
- ✅ "I just published my Python project template"

### Em-dashes
LinkedIn mangles em-dashes. Use regular dashes or rewrite around them.
- ❌ "I built Griffin—a reinforcement learning system—that handles notifications"
- ✅ "I built Griffin, a reinforcement learning system that handles notifications"

### Listicles
No bullet points with emoji markers or feature lists.
- ❌ "What's included: ✓ FastAPI ✓ PostgreSQL ✓ Redis"
- ✅ "The template includes FastAPI for the API layer, PostgreSQL for persistent data, and Redis for caching, all pre-wired together"

### Clickbait and Drama
- ❌ "This one weird trick cuts project setup time by 80%"
- ❌ "I almost gave up on this project three times"
- ❌ "Here's a story that will blow your mind"
- ✅ "I spent the weekend building a template that cuts our project setup time significantly"

### "Here's Why/How/The Story"
Avoid these manufactured narrative setups.
- ❌ "Here's why this matters..."
- ❌ "Here's how I built it..."
- ❌ "Here's the story..."
- ✅ Just write naturally without the setup

### Self-Promotion
No requests to follow, share, or use your work.
- ❌ "Try it out and let me know what you think!"
- ❌ "Follow for more engineering insights"
- ❌ "Share this with your network"
- ✅ "If you're dealing with similar problems, this approach is worth exploring"

### Feature Dumps
Don't just list features. Explain why they matter or how they fit together.
- ❌ "Includes FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, React"
- ✅ "The setup handles async database connections, background job processing, in-memory caching, and a React frontend—all integrated so they work together"

## Structure and Flow

### Opening (1-2 sentences)
Start with genuine motivation, problem, or insight—not a hook.

**Good openings:**
- "I spent the last month building..."
- "I kept running into the same problem..."
- "What surprised me when building this..."
- "I discovered that..."

**Bad openings:**
- "Just launched something incredible"
- "This will change everything"
- "You won't believe what I built"
- "Here's a story..."

### Middle (3-5 sentences)
Explain what you did, why, and what you learned.

**Structure:**
1. What's the problem/question/curiosity?
2. What did you explore/build?
3. What's the interesting insight or discovery?
4. Why does this matter?

### Closing (1-2 sentences)
Optional reflection or implication. Required: link to your article.

**Good closings:**
- "If you're working on similar problems..."
- "What surprised me most was..."
- Just the link (sometimes the post speaks for itself)

**Bad closings:**
- "Follow me for more insights"
- "Share this with your team"
- "Like if you agree"
- "Check out the link in my bio"

## Length Guidelines

### Short Posts (200-400 words)
- 2-3 paragraphs
- One main insight
- Good for simple topics
- Quick read for busy professionals

### Medium Posts (500-800 words)
- 3-4 paragraphs
- Most blog articles fit here
- Mix of context and insight
- Some specific examples

### Long Posts (1000+ words)
- 5-7+ paragraphs
- For complex topics or detailed exploration
- Rich with examples and technical detail
- Tell a fuller story

## Final Checklist

Before sharing your post, ask yourself:

- [ ] Does this sound like me talking to a colleague about my work?
- [ ] Is the opening genuine curiosity/motivation, not manufactured drama?
- [ ] Am I sharing what I learned, not just what I built?
- [ ] Are there specific examples and details?
- [ ] Did I avoid ALL emojis?
- [ ] Did I avoid em-dashes?
- [ ] Did I avoid listicles and bullet points?
- [ ] Did I avoid "Here's why/how/the story"?
- [ ] Is the article link clearly visible?
- [ ] Would someone think "this person is sharing genuine work" vs "this person is trying to get me to click"?
- [ ] If someone asked "why did you write this article?", would the post answer that question?

If it reads like ChatGPT wrote it or like a marketing post, keep rewriting until it sounds authentically like your voice sharing your work.
