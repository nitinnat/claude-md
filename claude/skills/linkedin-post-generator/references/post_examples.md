## Good Examples

### Example 1: Technical Article (Authentic)
```
I just read how Wayfair built Griffin, their reinforcement learning system for deciding
which emails and push notifications to send customers.

What stuck with me wasn't that they're using RL - it's why. They had four separate ML
models making send decisions, causing duplicate messages and poor coordination. Griffin
unified this into one model that learns from customer reactions without constant A/B testing.

The clever part: they use email engagement metrics (clicks, unsubscribes) as a proxy for
long-term conversion. Why? Measuring actual conversion takes 6+ weeks and gets muddied by
other changes. This is a smart trade-off between signal speed and accuracy.

Their next move is expanding across all notification channels (emails, push, triggered messages).
The architecture they built is flexible enough to handle this. Once it's learning from all
channels together, cross-channel optimization becomes implicit in the model's decisions.

```

**Why it works:**
- Starts with genuine observation ("What stuck with me")
- Explains the problem they solved first
- Highlights the interesting trade-off decision
- Uses first person naturally
- No emojis, no em-dashes, no drama
- Ends with clean URL
- Sounds like a peer sharing, not a marketer

### Example 2: Business Article (Conversational)
```
Found an interesting perspective on why onboarding is where most product adoptions actually
fail, not in the product itself.

The article walks through how companies often build great products but then hand customers
a 50-page manual. The friction kills adoption before users ever realize the value exists.

What made this stick: they framed onboarding as a product multiplier. You can build a 10x
better product, but if onboarding is 2x more complex, you've lost your advantage. Net result:
no improvement.

The actionable part wasn't complicated - invest in your first-day experience as much as your
core features. Get people to their first win in minutes, not days.

```

**Why it works:**
- Opens with what was interesting, not hype
- Explains the core insight clearly
- Includes a concrete framing ("product multiplier")
- Practical takeaway at the end
- Natural, thinking-out-loud tone
- No self-promotion or follow requests

## Bad Examples (Anti-patterns)

**Why it fails:**
- Emojis and artificial urgency
- Self-promotion first, value second
- Listicle format
- CTA asking for engagement metrics
- Sounds like a marketer, not a person

### Bad Example 2: Clickbait and Drama
```
DeepSeek just solved one of AI's oldest problems using a 60-year-old algorithm.

(This is about to change everything)

When deep learning took off, researchers hit a wall. You couldn't stack layers endlessly
without everything breaking. It was a crisis.

ResNets fixed this in 2016. But then hyperconnections came along...

And that's where it all falls apart.

[dramatic pause]

DeepSeek went back to first principles. They asked: what if we could mathematically GUARANTEE
stability?

The answer was hiding in 1967.

```

**Why it fails:**
- Clickbait opening and artificial drama
- "Here's the story:" narrative setup
- Dramatic pauses and manufactured tension
- Treated like a thriller, not a technical article
- Ends with follow request
- Too breathless and hype-y

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Good | Bad |
|--------|------|-----|
| Opening | Genuine observation | Clickbait or hype |
| Structure | Natural paragraphs | Listicles or dramatic beats |
| Voice | Peer sharing | Marketer promoting |
| Emojis | None | Multiple |
| Ending | Source link | Follow/share request |
| Drama | None | Manufactured tension |
| Focus | Insight first | Promotion first |
