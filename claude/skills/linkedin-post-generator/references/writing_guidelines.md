# LinkedIn Writing Guidelines for Authentic Posts

## Core Principles

### 1. Authenticity First
Write as if you're grabbing coffee with a colleague and sharing something interesting you read. Not as if you're pitching them something.

**Test**: If a colleague asked "what did you learn from that article?", does your post answer that naturally? If it feels like a sales pitch instead, rewrite it.

### 2. Value-First Mindset
Lead with what your audience gains, not what you're promoting.

**Bad**: "Check out this amazing resource I found..."
**Good**: "I found something interesting about how X works that challenges the assumption that..."

### 3. Conversational Tone
Write like you speak. Natural pauses, casual language, contractions.

**Bad**: "The aforementioned article elucidates a profound insight regarding..."
**Good**: "The interesting part is that they're not using X the way most people think..."

### 4. Specific Over General
Use real numbers, quotes, and examples. Vague summaries feel corporate and fake.

**Bad**: "They discussed innovative approaches to problem-solving."
**Good**: "They use email engagement metrics (clicks, unsubscribes) as a proxy for long-term conversion, which is clever because..."

## Technical Articles

When explaining technical content:
- Don't oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy
- Use technical terms when they're necessary, but explain them briefly
- Focus on the "why" and "so what" not just the "what"
- Help non-technical readers understand why it matters

**Example**:
```
They use something called "doubly stochastic" matrices to guarantee mathematical stability.
That's fancy for: rows and columns each sum to 1, which prevents amplification from exploding
across layers. It's a constraint that guarantees stability by math, not luck.
```

## Business/General Articles

When discussing business or general content:
- Ground insights in the specific article, not general knowledge
- Share what surprised you
- Connect to practical implications
- Avoid obvious statements ("companies should be customer-focused")

**Example**:
```
Most product companies obsess over the core feature quality. But this article made the case
that onboarding is where adoptions actually die. A 10x better product with 2x more complex
onboarding nets you nothing.
```

## Structure and Flow

### Opening (1-2 sentences)
Start with what you found interesting, not a hook.

**Good openings**:
- "I just read about how Wayfair built..."
- "Found an interesting perspective on..."
- "Came across a technical deep-dive on..."
- "Saw a great article about how..."

**Bad openings**:
- "DeepSeek just fixed one of AI's oldest problems"
- "Here's a story that will blow your mind"
- "You won't believe what I found"

### Middle (3-5 sentences)
Explain what's interesting and why it matters.

**Structure**:
1. What's the problem or context?
2. What approach did they take?
3. What's the interesting insight or trade-off?
4. Why does this matter?

### Closing (1-2 sentences)
Optional: Share a personal reflection or implication.
Required: Include the original URL on its own line.

**Good closings**:
- "What caught my attention..." + URL
- "The clever part is..." + URL
- Just the URL (sometimes the post speaks for itself)

**Bad closings**:
- "Share this if you found it insightful"
- "Follow me for more insights"
- "Like and comment below"
- "Full link in my bio"

## Things to Avoid

### Emojis
No emojis. Not decorative ones, not the pointing finger, not the rocket ship.
Period.

### Em-dashes
LinkedIn sometimes mangles em-dashes. Use regular dashes (—) or rewrite around them.

**Bad**: "They use RL—a technique that..."
**Good**: "They use reinforcement learning, a technique that..."

### Clickbait and Drama
- "X just solved Y's biggest problem"
- "Here's why companies are getting this wrong"
- "Nobody talks about this but..."
- "This one weird trick..."
- Dramatic one-liners for effect

### Listicles
No bullet points with emoji markers. No "5 things I learned."

**Bad**:
```
⛳ Structured learning paths
⛳ Project ideas
⛳ Interview prep
```

**Good**: Natural paragraphs explaining each concept.

### Self-Promotion
- No requests to follow, share, or comment
- No "tag someone who..."
- No "share this with your network"
- No promotion of your own product unless it's genuinely relevant

### Manufactured Suspense
- "Here's the story..."
- "Here's why..."
- "Here's how..."
- Pausing mid-sentence for dramatic effect

## Length Guidelines

### Short Posts (500-700 words)
- 2-3 natural paragraphs
- Good for news/quick takes
- One main insight
- Minimal context needed

### Medium Posts (800-1200 words)
- 3-5 paragraphs
- Good for most articles
- Mix of context and insight
- Some specific examples

### Long Posts (1300+ words)
- 5-7+ paragraphs
- For complex topics or deep dives
- Rich with examples and data
- Tell a fuller story

## Calls-to-Action (When They Work)

CTAs work best when they're honest and emerge naturally from the content.

**Good CTAs** (rare - usually the post works better without):
- Open question: "What's your experience with this?"
- Honest curiosity: "Has anyone else seen this pattern?"

**Never use**:
- "Share this if you found it valuable"
- "Like if you agree"
- "Follow me for more"
- "Comment below"
- "Tag someone who..."

## Final Checklist

Before posting, ask yourself:

- [ ] Does this sound like me talking to a colleague, or like a marketer?
- [ ] Is the opening a genuine observation or manufactured drama?
- [ ] Does it lead with value or self-promotion?
- [ ] Are there specific examples or just general statements?
- [ ] Did I avoid all emojis?
- [ ] Did I avoid em-dashes?
- [ ] Did I avoid listicles and bullet points?
- [ ] Is the URL clearly visible at the end?
- [ ] Would I be uncomfortable if this seemed self-promotional? (If yes, remove that part)
- [ ] Does it sound authentic, or like it was written by ChatGPT?

If it sounds like ChatGPT wrote it, you're not done yet. Rewrite until it sounds like your actual voice.
