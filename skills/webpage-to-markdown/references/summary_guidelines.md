# Multi-Level Summary Guidelines

## Purpose
Generate three summaries of the same content at different complexity levels to serve different audiences.

## Level Definitions

### ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)
**Audience**: Anyone with no background knowledge
**Approach**:
- Use everyday words, avoid jargon
- Create relatable analogies (toys, games, family)
- Focus on the "what" not "how"
- One core idea only

**Example** (for a machine learning article):
> Imagine you have a robot friend who learns to sort your toys. At first, it makes mistakes, but every time you say "that's wrong" or "that's right," it gets better. Eventually, it can sort toys perfectly without your help!

### High School
**Audience**: General educated public
**Approach**:
- Introduce key technical terms with brief explanations
- Explain cause and effect relationships
- Include concrete examples
- Cover 2-3 main points

**Example**:
> This article explains how machine learning models improve through a process called training. By feeding the model thousands of examples and correcting its mistakes, the algorithm gradually learns to recognize patterns. The key innovation here is using reinforcement learning, where the model receives rewards for correct decisions.

### College Graduate
**Audience**: Someone with relevant domain expertise
**Approach**:
- Use proper technical terminology
- Reference established concepts and frameworks
- Discuss nuances, trade-offs, and implications
- Mention methodology and results

**Example**:
> The paper presents a novel approach to contextual bandit problems using Thompson Sampling with neural network function approximation. The key contribution is addressing the cold-start problem in recommendation systems by leveraging transfer learning from a pre-trained language model. Results demonstrate a 15% improvement in click-through rate compared to epsilon-greedy baselines.

## Quality Checklist
- Each summary is self-contained (doesn't reference other levels)
- Complexity genuinely differs between levels
- All summaries are factually accurate
- No oversimplification that distorts meaning
- Length: 2-4 sentences per level
