# Blog Writer Skill

Research, write, and publish well-sourced technical blog posts with images and screenshots.

## What This Skill Does

Guides you through creating publication-ready blog posts by:
1. Researching the topic extensively using Exa web search
2. Validating all factual claims against credible sources
3. Generating relevant images using Gemini
4. Capturing screenshots from actual websites when appropriate
5. Formatting the post to match the existing blog style

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Write a new blog post about a technical topic
- Research and validate claims in an existing draft
- Create a well-sourced article with proper images and screenshots

## Prerequisites

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in `.env` for image generation
- Exa MCP server configured for web research
- Playwright installed for screenshots
- Poetry environment set up

## Usage

Simply invoke this skill:
```
/blog-writer
```

Or with a topic:
```
/blog-writer <topic>
```

## What the Skill Does

### 1. Topic Research Phase
- Uses Exa to search for credible sources (news outlets, technical blogs, official documentation)
- Gathers 10-15 high-quality sources
- Validates key facts and claims
- Identifies notable quotes from experts or key figures

### 2. Content Planning Phase
- Determines blog structure (sections, flow)
- Identifies which claims need visual support
- Plans screenshots (actual websites/interfaces)
- Plans conceptual images (diagrams, visualizations)

### 3. Writing Phase
- Writes in the established blog tone:
  - Direct, objective technical writing
  - No AI slop (excessive praise, superlatives, defensive code)
  - No em dashes (use commas, semicolons, colons)
  - Balanced perspective (acknowledge nuance)
  - Fact-focused, not hype-focused
- Follows existing blog structure:
  - Clear sections with descriptive headers
  - Technical depth without jargon overload
  - Sources section at the end

### 4. Image Generation Phase
- Generates images using `gemini-image-generator` skill
- Creates 2-4 conceptual visualizations as needed
- Saves to `content/assets/`
- Uses descriptive alt text

### 5. Screenshot Capture Phase
- Captures screenshots using `screenshot-capture` skill
- Focuses on official websites, interfaces, or notable examples
- Saves to `content/assets/`

### 6. Validation Phase
- Cross-references all claims against sources
- Verifies all links are working
- Checks that numbers/dates are accurate
- Ensures proper attribution for quotes

### 7. Publishing Phase
- Creates `.mdx` file in `content/posts/`
- Uses correct frontmatter format:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Your Title Here"
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  description: "Brief description"
  tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
  categories: [category1, category2]
  draft: false
  ---
  ```
- References images as `/assets/image_name.png`
- Includes comprehensive sources section

## Blog Style Guidelines

### Tone
- **Objective and factual**: Prioritize accuracy over excitement
- **No excessive praise**: Avoid "amazing," "incredible" (unless quoting someone)
- **Balanced**: Acknowledge limitations, trade-offs, and concerns
- **Technical but accessible**: Explain complex topics without condescension

### Structure
- **Introduction**: Set context, explain why the topic matters
- **Main sections**: 3-5 major sections with clear headers
- **Conclusion**: Summarize key takeaways without overstating
- **Sources**: Comprehensive list with working links

### What to Avoid (AI Slop Patterns)
- Em dashes (use commas, semicolons, colons instead)
- Excessive exclamation points
- Superlatives without evidence ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Emoji (unless in code examples where relevant)
- "Let's dive in" or similar filler phrases
- Unnecessary comments or docstrings in code examples

### Images
- **2-4 images per post**
- Mix of screenshots (real interfaces) and generated visualizations
- Descriptive alt text
- Placed strategically to break up text and illustrate key points

### Sources
- **Minimum 8-10 credible sources**
- Prefer: Major news outlets, technical blogs, official documentation, research papers
- Avoid: Social media (unless primary source), low-quality blogs
- Include source titles and clean URLs

## Example Invocations

```
User: "Write a blog post about the new Claude 4 model"
Assistant: [Researches using Exa, validates claims, generates images, writes post]

User: "Create a post about Docker security best practices"
Assistant: [Researches, captures Docker website screenshots, generates diagrams, writes post]

User: "Review and improve this draft blog post about..."
Assistant: [Validates claims, adds sources, generates missing images, reformats]
```

## Output

- Blog post created at `content/posts/<slug>.mdx`
- Images saved to `content/assets/`
- Summary of sources used and claims validated
- Ready for git commit and publishing

## CRITICAL: No AI Attribution

**NEVER add any mention of AI authorship anywhere:**
- No "Generated by AI" or "Written with Claude" in posts
- No "Created with AI assistance" in commits
- No AI mentions in PR descriptions
- No author attribution to Claude or any AI system
- Blog posts should appear as human-written content

## Tips

- The skill will ask clarifying questions if the topic is ambiguous
- You can specify desired sections or angles
- You can request focus on specific aspects (security, performance, etc.)
- The skill follows the patterns from existing published posts
